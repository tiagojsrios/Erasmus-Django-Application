# Erasmus-Django-Application

Back to 2018, I did Erasmus in Bialystok, Poland at Bialystok University of Technology. There I had a course where I managed to learn and work with Django and Ruby on Rails. At the end of the course, I had to build an application chose by me and I could do it either on Django or Ruby on Rails.

With this scenario, I decided to build a blog where the users could read and share their own Erasmus' experiences. Of course, users had to create an account, first, and only after that they would be able to share their experience.

At the end, I managed to "deploy" it to PythonAnywhere where my project was available to everybody.

# What did I accomplished with this project?

I was able to put into one project everything that I learnt on **Python** & **Django Framework**. For database, I used **SQLite**. I developed everything with Python IDE from *JetBrains*, **PyCharm**.

# Ideas for the Future & Improvements

My initial idea was to continue this project during my summer vacations. However, I wasn't able to accomplish that as I had to prioritize other things in my life. Considering the feedback I received from the teacher and my own ideas, the following list contains some nice features that I could add into this project:

1. **Integration with Google Maps, where users could search for experiences via map;**
2. **Improve user account page;**
3. **The way the experiences are appearing in the front page looks buggy;**
4. **Account registration via Google/Facebook/Twitter.**
